# FirstARProject
In my debut AR project, I introduce an  experience, signalling my entry into Extended Reality(XR). Leveraging image detection tech, I've created my first app, enabling users to interact with a dragon. Despite being new, a user-friendly joystick adds control. Excited for XR's creative potential! (Android app in testing, with glitches).
